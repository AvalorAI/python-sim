# Quadcopter Dynamics Simulator
JBSim (but it is python)

## **Overview:**

This script simulates the dynamics of a quadcopter in a 3D environment. By integrating the forces and torques generated by the quadcopter's actuators, it computes the quadcopter's position, velocity, and angular orientation over time.

## Setup

1. Get PX4-Autopilot from https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git
2. Build PX4 in `Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh`
3. Open ports 4560 and 14540 (or disable firewall of you are lazy)
4. Open wsl terminal in PX4 folder
5. Run `ipconfig` on your Windows machine to find the WSL_IP
6. In your WSL terminal run `export PX4_SIM_HOST_ADDR=${WSL_IP}`
8. In WSL`PX4/PX4-Autopilot` run `make px4_sitl none_iris`
7. On your Windows machine, in python-sim/src run `py main.py`
8. Open QGC in WSL to see drone
